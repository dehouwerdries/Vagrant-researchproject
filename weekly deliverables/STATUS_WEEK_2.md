## Status
For the most part the project is going as we planned. There are a couple of issues with Microsoft Azure that were discovered in the last day and which couldn't immediately be rectified, so the second "Vagrant and the cloud" part will have to be re-written with another Cloud provider. However, this isn't a major issue and should be fixed in the next day or so.
